This repo is for the small Demi Bot using the 2025 interface.
It's intended to be used when the RIO-1 with the broken USB is installed.  Since that RIO cannot be updated for 2026 firmware, this repo uses the 2025 development environment.

Demi is a tank drive. 
One XBOX controller.
Left stick controls left side,  Right stick controls right side.
